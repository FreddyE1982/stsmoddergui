# Slay the Spire mod loading references

## ModTheSpire launcher basics
- Source: https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/blob/master/README.md
- Key points:
  - Download latest release, copy `ModTheSpire.jar` (plus platform scripts) to Slay the Spire install directory.
  - Create a `mods` directory next to the jar and place mod JARs inside.
  - Run `ModTheSpire` (via `MTS.cmd`, `MTS.sh`, or directly with Java 8), select the mods to enable, then press **Play** to launch the game with those mods.

## Steam Workshop mod launcher flow

- Key points:
  - Steam Workshop lets players subscribe to ModTheSpire and BaseMod utilities alongside gameplay mods.
  - When starting Slay the Spire after subscribing, the in-game mod manager lists subscribed mods so you can tick boxes to enable or untick to disable them.
  - Workshop subscriptions keep utilities and gameplay mods updated automatically for the next launch.
